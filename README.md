Our motivation for the project is to provide our customer with user data while providing the user entertainment. Something short, easy and fun for the user allows our customer a way to collect useful information.
The project allows customers to collect the userâ€™s data for marketing and research purposes. Also, provides users a chance to know what Yoda has to say about them based on their input.
